          <span class="section-maintitle">Why Another Dating App?</span><br />
          Most dating apps feel more like a game than a way to actually meet
          someone. You spend hours scrolling through profiles, starting chats
          that go nowhere, and wondering if anyone on the other side is even
          real. Then come the paywalls. You have to subscribe just to see who
          liked you or to send a message. It starts to feel less like you're
          trying to find a real connection and more like you're stuck in a
          system designed to keep you paying and alone. It's exhausting, and we
          got tired of it.

          <span class="section-maintitle">So We Created InPrson Dates.</span
          ><br />
          We built InPrson for people who are tired of all that. No
          subscriptions, no pay-to-unlock features, and no endless swiping. Just
          one simple identity check to make sure everyone is real, and then it’s
          free. Forever. We’re focused on helping people meet face-to-face, have
          real conversations, and maybe even build something lasting. That’s it.
          No tricks, no distractions, just dating the way it should be.

          <span class="section-maintitle">Our Mission</span><br />
          Dating used to be simple. You met someone, you talked, you felt
          something real. That’s what we want to bring back. We’re not here to
          trap you in endless swipes or monthly fees. We’re here to create a
          space where people are honest, present, and serious about connection.
          <!-- <br /><br /> -->
          Our goal is simple: to help you go on real dates. Because that’s the
          only way to truly know if you’re compatible. It’s the only way to feel
          the vibe, read their energy, and see if something meaningful is there.
          Texting is fine, but it’s no substitute for showing up in person.
          <!-- <br /><br /> -->
          More InPrson dates. More lasting relationships. That’s the kind of
          love we believe in, and the kind we’re here to build.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="section-maintitle">Together We Make This Work.</span
          ><br />
          InPrson is free to use and always will be. No subscriptions, no hidden
          features, no upsells. Instead of charging you to message or match, we
          ask for a one-time identity verification fee of $18.37 once your
          account is approved. This helps keep the community safe, respectful,
          and full of real people looking for real relationships.
          That small fee covers the cost of secure third-party verification and
          helps support the platform. It’s not about profit, it’s about
          protecting the experience for everyone. After that, everything is
          open. Always.
